# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
After cleaning and combining two different datasets (school and students), a thorough school district analysis surrounding 15 schools has been conducted to reveal possible factors that could impact the perforamce of the school.  The district officials could make use of the analysis to determine how money could be allocated to each school and the school board could set strategies and targets for the school.

The list of deliverables includes:
-   a high-level school district summary,
- school summary for each school,
- a list of the top and low performing schools,
- the scores by grade for each school,
- the scores by school spneding,
- the scores by school size, and
- the scores by school type.


## Results
Impacts of replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School as there is evidence of academic dishonesty.

- How is the district summary affected?
    - The average math score, the percentage of students passing math test, the percentage of students passing reading test and the overall passing percentage are lowered after the math and reading scores of the ninth graders of Thomas High School being removed.
